## Problem Description

<p>Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.</p>

<p>A sudoku solution must satisfy <strong>all of the following rules</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each row.</li>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each column.</li>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each of the 9 <code>3x3</code> sub-boxes of the grid.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>'.'</code> character indicates empty cells.</p>

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We can solve this question Matrix + Backtracking.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We can easily understand the approach by seeing the code which is easy to understand with comments.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Time Complexity : O(9^(N*N)) : For every unassigned index there are 9 possible options so the worst-case time complexity of sudoku solver is O(9^(N*N)).

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
Space Complexity : O(1), Constant space.

# Code
```
